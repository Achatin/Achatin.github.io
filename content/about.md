Hi, my name is *Simon* 👋. But on the Internet, I go by *Achatin*. I'm a second-year student at the Technical University in Kosice. I study computer science but I'm an enthusiast for everything technology-related 🤖

I made a variety of projects. However, only a few were truly finished. So, I made this website as my personal portfolio to encourage finishing my projects in order to be put here 🏆

Additionally, to keep track of my research, I will post notes to my blog.
